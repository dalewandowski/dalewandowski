Hello! 🙋‍♂️

My name is Damian Lewandowski, and I work as an operator in a company that produces animal feed. 
In my free time, I am passionate about learning programming. My current job has helped me develop many valuable skills necessary for a programmer, such as responsibility, patience, teamwork, attention to detail, and precision in tasks.  🏭

I am a happy husband and a proud father of a wonderful son, and soon our family will grow with another child on the way. This motivates me even more to advance my career and achieve my goal of becoming a programmer. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

So far, I have mastered technologies such as:                          
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, REST API, React, MySQL, Git, and GitHub. 💻

I am also familiar with the basics of Linux, PHP, Postman, MongoDB, and Sass. I plan to expand my skills by learning TypeScript, Vue, Angular, and further developing my backend knowledge. 📖📗📘

Although I know some English, my goal is professional growth and transitioning into a programming role. I am ready to take on a junior position, fully determined to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the IT field. 📈🔝
